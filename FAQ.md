## Quality Items

What are quality items?

Quality items are a way to show the "quality" of a coin.  These items cannot be opinion items but must have a link or proof of existing.  This will give a better understanding of the "quality" of a coin.

Each quality item is usually a linkable infrastructure item for the coin, number of pairs, or market cap.

Some of the items, such as website is something that every coin should have, while other items such as hardware wallet are more difficult for a coin to have.

All quality items are weighted by a point value.  This point value can be changed in the future as we balance the weight of each quality item to best rank a coin.

Most quality items are a yes or no question with a link meaning yes.  For example, in the list below, Website is the question, “Does the coin have a website?”  If the answer is yes, a link is required to prove this.

You can look at each coin’s quality items and their weight on the coins home page.

Current quality items are:
* Age of coin (generated from first block on current blockchain)
* Market Cap of coin (though only slightly weighted)
* Website (Link)
* Open Source (Link)
* Block Explorer (Link)
* Number of pairs (generated automatically by xplorenow API calls)
