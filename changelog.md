XploreNow is a coin ranking site that ranks coins and exchanges by quality and market cap.

XploreNow is a closed source, for profit, non-Terracoin Foundation, side project of mine.

This repository will be used to track issues, version and the roadmap.

The best way to submit an issue is to use the issue tab on this repository.

If you want to get a hold of me for listings or other questions you can find me on the various Terracoin social media or at @XploreCryptoNow on Twitter.
